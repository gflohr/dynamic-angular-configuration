# DynamicAngularConfiguration

This project is an accompanying git repository to the blog post
[Dynamic Angular Configuration](https://www.guido-flohr.net/dynamic-angular-configuration/).

## Description

The conventional Angular approach is to compile configuration into the build
image, so that you have create a separate build for every environment that
you support.  This repo follows a different approach and loads the configuration
at runtime.  See [Dynamic Angular
Configuration](https://www.guido-flohr.net/dynamic-angular-configuration/) for
more details.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
